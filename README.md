<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

I needed a template for my c++ projects to be more DRY. There is many other C++ template but I needed one that is more specific to me needs:

This template configure a project with unit testing using Catch2, integrate static analysis to the build process with clang-tidy, allow project formatting with clang-format and generate the documentaton with doxygen.

Here's why:
* Documentation generation with doxygen included to the compilation process 
* Static analysis with clang-tidy included to the compilation process
* Code formatting enabled with clang-format
* Code coverage analysis and reporting setup with gcov/lcov/gcovr
* Unit testing setup 

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This project is built using CMake.
* [CMake 3.14](https://cmake.org)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install CMake 
This project use CMake for build configuration, you will need it.

##### Windows
Download binaries from [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

##### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

#### 2. Install Clang tools (optional)

To do source formatting and static analysis we use clang tools.

##### Windows
Download binaries from [llvm](https://releases.llvm.org/)
Say yes to add Llvm/bin install directory to Path variable when asked

##### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install clang-format 
sudo apt-get install clang-tidy
```

To use clang tools it is better to generate compilation database. cmake offer an easy way

```sh
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
ln -s compile_commands.json ../compile_commands.json
```

#### 3. Install Doxygen (optional)

For documation generation we use doxygen.

##### Windows
Download binaries from [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)

##### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```

#### 4. Install Catch2 (optional)
For unit testing we use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)

##### Ubuntu
```sh
cd somewhere_i_want_to_put_catch2_sources
git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
cd Catch2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```
#### 4. Install gcovr (optional)

For code coverage reporting I use gcovr 

##### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install gcovr
```

### Installation

Now that you have installed the dependencies you need you just have to compile and install the project

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bertouz/CppProject
```
2. Build project
```sh
cd CppProject
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_DOC=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_CLANG_FORMAT=OFF -DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF -DENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_installation_dir ..
make -j4
```

4. Install project
```sh
make install
```
